Template Explorer can be found below the workspace in the VSCode File Explorer window. Template Explorer helps you manage templates with the ability to add, edit and delete them. Right-clicking a template in template explorer will allow you to go directly to the template directory for editing the template, create the templated project or item in your workspace, or export the template as a shareable zip file.
