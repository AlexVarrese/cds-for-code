# ![Cloudsmith Consulting LLC](https://cloudsmithstatics.azureedge.net/web/cloudsmith-notagline-450x103.png "Cloudsmith Consulting")<br> Welcome to the CloudSmith CDS For Code Extension
This extension is designed to help developers with a simple development loop for Microsoft&trade; Common Data Service (CDS) using Visual Studio Code.  Many developers do not have access to a full Visual Studio license in order to use Microsoft&trade; CDS Development Toolkit.  This sample solution is designed to get you started.

Release version: 0.8.5

The VsCode addin handles these tasks in your development loop.

- [X] Connect to CDS environments (8.0+)
- [X] View and inspect metadata on each server connection
- [X] Package and deploy CDS solutions from server into version control
- [X] Package and deploy CDS solution from version control into server
- [X] Generate entities using CrmSvcUtil
- [ ] Customize the CrmSvcUtil experience (coming soon)
- [X] Author web resources with VsCode
- [X] Put CDS solution assets into version control
- [x] Build and deploy plugins using VsCode
- [x] Deploy assets into solution using pre-made templates

## Prerequisites

Before you start you must install the Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell module. To do this run PowerShell **as Administrator** and then execute the following command:

``` PowerShell
Install-Package Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell
```

The remaining dependancies will be downloaded on the first activation of the CDS for Code extension.
